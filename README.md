## Dino Readme

I've been a developer for a long time.  I've done some C#, but more recently
it's been JavaScript, Java, and a little Golang.

I like to build all sorts of tools that I think will be handy. and I like crypto.

Some examples of web-based tools I've built:
- [JWT decoder and generator](https://dinochiesa.github.io/jwt)
- [HTTP Signature verifier and generator](https://dinochiesa.github.io/httpsig/)
- [RSA or EC keypair generator](https://dinochiesa.github.io/download-keypair/)
- [HMAC or SHA calculator](https://dinochiesa.github.io/hmachash/index.html)
